## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is the main website/landing page for Vikings Web Developer, my future company of web and software development. When young, I always dream about having a website, something that the adults would think: "It's just a kid's thing, it'll cool with time", and really was, but hey, we're making it happen.

This page is propose to be the main system for branding and publicizing the company's services, values, culture, partners and professional interaction with clients.
